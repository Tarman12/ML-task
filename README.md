# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

This repository contains the solutions to the eCommerce Data Science assignment. The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Perform exploratory data analysis on customer, product, and transaction data, and derive actionable business insights.
2. **Task 2: Lookalike Model** – Build a model to recommend similar customers based on transaction and profile information.
3. **Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering** – Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their profiles and transaction behaviors.
